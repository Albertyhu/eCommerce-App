I can't find the solution to the following error:

� An error occurred during the push operation: Unknown directive "connection".

I'm going to have to work around it or try to get in touch with AWS Amplify support

I have completely set up GraphUL integration. I stopped at deploying API section
https://docs.amplify.aws/start/getting-started/data-model/q/integration/react-native/#create-a-graphql-api-and-database

Schema still needs to be configured.
